How to upload an entire folder in git reprository?
----------------------------------------------------

There isn't a way to upload an entire folder through the web UI. The easiest way to do that would be to:

1). Clone the repository locally


Cloning a repository using the command line
Step 1: On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

Note: If the repository is empty, you can manually copy the repository page's URL from your browser and skip to step four.

Step 2: Under the repository name, click Clone or download.
Clone or download button

Step 3: To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click . To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click Use SSH, then click .
Clone URL button

Step 4: Open Git Bash.

Step 5: Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

Step 6: Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

Step 7: Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.

2).Make the changes to the local version
$ git add .
# Adds the file to your local repository and stages it for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.

3).Commit the changes locally
$ git commit -m "Add existing file"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.

4).Push the changes back up to the GitHub repository
$ git push origin your-branch
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository
